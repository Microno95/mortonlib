# Mortonlib

A lib for basic arithmetic with morton code.


## Encoding/Decoding

If BMI2 instructions set is available on your processor (intel i5, i7 and some Xeon), 
mortonlib will use pext and pdep instructions to encode/decode morton code.
Else, we rely on a precomputed look-up table. This last method is slower but works on all processors.
You can set the flag USE_BMI2 to define which strategy you want to use.

If you don't have BMI2 instructions and you don't have to encode coordinates greater than (256,256,256), you can use the morton3d_256(x, y, z) function which is a bit faster than the generic one.

```c++

//Encode 2d morton code
morton2 m0 = morton2(x, y);

//Encode 3d morton code
morton3 m1 = morton3(x, y, z);

//if x, y and z < 256 and USE_BMI2 not set
morton3 m2 = morton3d_256(x, y, z);

//Decode 3d morton code
int x, y, z;
m1.decode(x, y, z);

```

## Additions, substractions, increments

You can add and substract morton codes without decoding and re-encoding them.

```c++

//Add two morton keys
morton3(0,0,0) + morton3(1,2,3) == morton3(1,2,3);

//Substract two morton keys
morton3(4,5,6) - morton3(1,2,3) == morton3(3,3,3);

```
